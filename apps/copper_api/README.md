# CopperApi

## Description

Author(s): Nathan Casados (marth141 @ github)

This application is for interacting with Copper and essentially serves as a wrapper on the Copper REST endpoint.

It is not very structured well as it was my (Nathan Casados) first experience with writing Elixir code.

Big props for Zack White (zblanco @ github) 👏👏👏 For helping with guiding me through building but giving me the freedom to do it on my own.

Can it be better? Absolutely. Was it a good experience, very much so.

## Installation

by adding `copper_api` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:
